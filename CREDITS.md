## Smart Cards

  + [A Case for Native Smart Card Support in Browsers](https://techblog.bozho.net/case-native-smart-card-support-browsers/) - "Now, signature is one thing, identification (TLS client auth) is another. Allegedly, things should work there ‚Äì PKCS#11 is a standard that should allow TLS client auth to happen with a smart card. Reality is ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt. You often need a vendor-specific PKCS#11 library. OpenSC, which is a cool tool that works with many smart cards, only works with Firefox and Safari"


## OpenSC

  + [Installing OpenSC PKCS#11 Module in Firefox, Step by Step](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki/Installing-OpenSC-PKCS%2311-Module-in-Firefox%2C-Step-by-Step)

Install opensc:

```sh
brew install opensc
```

Detect if a card-reader is present:

```sh
opensc-tool -n
```

```sh
pkcs15-tool --list-public-keys
```

```sh
pkcs15-tool --read-public-key 1
```

```sh
pkcs15-tool --read-certificate 1 | openssl x509 -noout -text
```

## Max.Gov

  + [MAX.gov Login](https://login.max.gov/cas/login) - "Users with a working PIV or CAC card can associate their card with an existing MAX account. This provides 2-factor authentication that is more secure than a User ID and Password for accessing sensitive-but-unclassified (SBU) content setup to require MAX Secure+. To associate your PIV or CAC card you will need your MAX UserID and a working password. (Thereafter you will be able to login to MAX using just your PIV or CAC card and its built-in PIN number.)"

```sh

```

    ######################################################################## 100.0%
    ==> Pouring nginx-1.13.9.sierra.bottle.tar.gz
    ==> Caveats
    Docroot is: /usr/local/var/www

    The default port has been set in /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf to 8080 so that
    nginx can run without sudo.

    nginx will load all files in /usr/local/etc/nginx/servers/.

    To have launchd start nginx now and restart at login:
      brew services start nginx
    Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
      nginx
    ==> Summary
    üç∫  /usr/local/Cellar/nginx/1.13.9: 23 files, 1.4MB


### Running NGINX Locally

  + Installing and configuring NGINX on Mac OS w/ homebrew:
    + [circa 2012](http://learnaholic.me/2012/10/10/installing-nginx-in-mac-os-x-mountain-lion/)
    + [circa 2015](https://medium.com/@ThomasTan/installing-nginx-in-mac-os-x-maverick-with-homebrew-d8867b7e8a5a)

Inspect the configuration file:

```sh
atom /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

Start the server to test the installation:

```sh
brew services start nginx # then visit http://localhost:8080/ to find a welcome message
```

Stop the server, then make adjustments to the config file:

```sh
brew services stop nginx
```
